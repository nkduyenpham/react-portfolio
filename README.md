## About Me

From the moment I first learned to code and ran a simple "Hello World" in my console, I knew I was hooked on software development. For me, software engineering has never been "just a 9-5 job." It has provided an environment where I can challenge myself, apply my problem-solving skills, and continuously learn and improve to create awesome, high-quality software. What began with a simple "Hello World" has evolved into a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as the years go by.

Below, you'll find my professional experience showcasing my skills and general background in software development.
